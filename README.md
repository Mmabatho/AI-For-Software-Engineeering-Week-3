## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in your preferred environment (JupyterLab, Colab, or VS Code).
2. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the experiments and results.
3. Review the outputs, plots, and printed summaries for insights and analysis.

## Key Learnings

- **Classical ML:**  
  Explored the full ML workflow on a small, clean dataset (Iris), including feature engineering and model evaluation.
- **Deep Learning:**  
  Built and trained a convolutional neural network from scratch for image classification, achieving high accuracy on MNIST.
- **NLP & Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Applied NLP techniques for text preprocessing, sentiment classification, and model fine-tuning on Amazon reviews.
- **Evaluation:**  
  Used multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix) and visualizations to assess model performance.
